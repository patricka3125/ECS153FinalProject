## Jonathan Hsu
This week I implemented completed basic forum functionality. This includes setting up the server, database, writing the frontend and connecting it to the design. This week, I'm going to continue implementing authentication and access control. I haven't encountered any issues so far.

## Patrick Liao
This week I implemented the user database and ability to sign up. Currently
have the sign up page and server add user functions done. This week I will
focus on finishing user authentication, including user login, logout function
and assigning user priorities. User authentication is taking longer than expected
due to unfamiliarity with node.js and express environment.

## Zaprin Ignatiev
This week I worked on Access Control. More specifically, I researched role
based access control (RBAC). I looked into good practices for implementation
as well security libraries that could come in handy. I came up with an idea for
implementation; however, currently I am stuck on getting used to working with
servers and data bases. I will focus on setting up a basic access control with
the following specifications: Admin( can: read, write, delete),
User( can: read, write) and Guest( can: read). I want to finish it by the end of
the week and make it functional. Once this is ready, I will work on modifying it
to our access control specifications, which can be found in our data base set up
excel document or on Trello.
