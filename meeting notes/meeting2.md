## Jonathan Hsu
This week I implemented completed basic forum functionality. This includes setting up the server, database, writing the frontend and connecting it to the design. This week, I'm going to continue implementing authentication and access control. I haven't encountered any issues so far. 

## Patrick Liao
This week I implemented the user database and ability to sign up. Currently
have the sign up page and server add user functions done. This week I will 
focus on finishing user authentication, including user login, logout function
and assigning user priorities. User authentication is taking longer than expected
due to unfamiliarity with node.js and express environment.
